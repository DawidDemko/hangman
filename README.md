# Hangman the Game
The game is to find a secret word by guessing letters. However, guess a wrong letter one time too many and your lifeless body will hang from the gallows.

The game itself is included in the *"hangman.py"*, but the editable wordlist is included in *"words.py"*. Both should be in one file in order for the game to work properly.
